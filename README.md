### Projects

#### Reddit sentiment and Tesla’s stock price Correlation Analysis
A data science research project exploring the relationship between public sentiment on Reddit and Tesla’s stock price movement, leveraging NLP and machine learning techniques.

#### Key Components:

Data Collection: Scraped thousands of Reddit posts from finance-related subreddits using the Pushshift API, focusing on discussions about Tesla.

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Performed NLP preprocessing including tokenization, lemmatization, stopword removal, and sentiment scoring using VADER and TextBlob.

Feature Engineering: Aggregated daily sentiment scores, user engagement metrics, and post frequency; aligned these with daily Tesla stock data from yFinance.

#### Modeling:

Built time-series models (ARIMA, LSTM) to forecast stock price trends using sentiment-based features.

Evaluated models using RMSE and MAE; compared predictive accuracy of statistical vs. deep learning models.

Analysis: Performed Granger Causality Tests to investigate directional influence between sentiment and price changes.

Tools Used: Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, Keras, TensorFlow, yFinance, Pushshift API, Matplotlib, Seaborn

#### Outcome:
Found moderate short-term correlations between Reddit sentiment trends and Tesla stock price fluctuations. Built an interactive Flask-based dashboard to visualize real-time sentiment and stock trends.

#### Kaggle Rohlik Competition

The Rohlik competition focused on developing a product recommendation system for a large European e-grocery retailer. Participants were given anonymized transactional data and were tasked with predicting the next best purchase for individual customers using machine learning and recommender system techniques.

This challenge involved real-world complexities such as sparse purchase histories, cold-start problems, and personalized user behavior, making it an excellent opportunity to apply collaborative filtering, feature engineering, and ranking models to build scalable and accurate recommendations.
