    <div class="project">
      <h3>1. Reddit Sentiment and Tesla’s Stock Price Correlation Analysis</h3>
      <p>A data science research project exploring the relationship between public sentiment on Reddit and Tesla’s stock price movement, leveraging NLP and machine learning techniques.</p>

      <p class="key-section">Key Components:</p>
      <div class="section-content">
        <p><strong>Data Collection:</strong> Scraped thousands of Reddit posts from finance-related subreddits using the Pushshift API, focusing on discussions about Tesla.</p>
        <p><strong>Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:</strong> Performed NLP preprocessing including tokenization, lemmatization, stopword removal, and sentiment scoring using VADER and TextBlob.</p>
        <p><strong>Feature Engineering:</strong> Aggregated daily sentiment scores, user engagement metrics, and post frequency; aligned these with daily Tesla stock data from yFinance.</p>
        <p><strong>Modeling:</strong><br />
          Built time-series models (ARIMA, LSTM) to forecast stock price trends using sentiment-based features.<br />
          Evaluated models using RMSE and MAE; compared predictive accuracy of statistical vs. deep learning models.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Performed Granger Causality Tests to investigate directional influence between sentiment and price changes.</p>
        <p><strong>Tools Used:</strong> Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, Keras, TensorFlow, yFinance, Pushshift API, Matplotlib, Seaborn</p>
        <p><strong>Outcome:</strong><br />
          Found moderate short-term correlations between Reddit sentiment trends and Tesla stock price fluctuations.

      <h3>2. Kaggle Rohlik Competition</h3>
      <p>The Rohlik competition focused on developing a product recommendation system for a large European e-grocery retailer. Participants were given anonymized transactional data and were tasked with predicting the next best purchase for individual customers using machine learning and recommender system techniques.</p>

      <p>This challenge involved real-world complexities such as sparse purchase histories, cold-start problems, and personalized user behavior, making it an excellent opportunity to apply collaborative filtering, feature engineering, and ranking models to build scalable and accurate recommendations.</p>
